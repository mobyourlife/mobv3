Source code is ugly. Don't try to make it at home, kids!

Apart of jokes, this has been my first project ever written in Node.js. I wasn't used to Node.js callback oriented structure and never have heard about promises, so, everything is real ugly.

But it works, and have helped me a lot in my journey to learn more bad ways of writing code.

You've been warned. :)
